# quick word

Threw around some basic stuff here:
- deployment of flask hello world server ( ideally wanted to use python docker sdk and kube-client lib to talk to the api-server)
- simple service ( nodeport for testing on minikube ) + ingress ( minukube ingress addon started)
- very simple prometheus deployment to scape only cadvisor metrics
- also very bare grafana deployment with a quick dashboard thrown in there

Followed a bit of naming convention to match what would be used in an helm chart\
will continue updating until later
